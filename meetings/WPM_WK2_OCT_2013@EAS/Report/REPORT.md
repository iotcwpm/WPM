# Introduction

The Second Workshop on Management Strategy Evaluation (WK-MSE) of the Working Party (WPM) on Methods of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) took place in the afternoon of 23 October 2013, coinciding with the Fifteenth Session of the Working Party on Tropical Tunas (WPTT), held in San Sebastian, Spain. Members of WPTT attending the meeting were invited to join in the WPM workshop and took active part in the discussions.

This short workshop was held to (1) review the current status of ongoing work on MSE for IOTC stocks, and (2) agree on the development of future activities. Of special relevance was the presentation to WPTT of the recently started work on the development of Operating Models (OMs) for skipjack tuna, lead by Mr Nokome Bentley, working under contract with the Maldivian government.


# Presentations and discussion

The workshop was centered around a number of presentations covering both current work and planning of future activities.

## Using SS3 as a basis for Indian Ocean Albacore operating model: progress and problems (I. Mosqueira, EC JRC)

## Updated catch data for IO ALB (M. Herrera, IOTC)

The results of recent efforts at updating the catch statistics of Indonesia, and the effect of these changes on total and disagreggated catches of Indian Ocean albacore were presented. A report with the conclusions of the workshop that took place last June is available at the IOTC website, and a presentation was made noting the most important effects of this on the data being used to condition the albacore OMs.

Overall catch statistics have not being affected in a large scale, so the group considered that although future work will attempt to incorporate these revised figures, the changes are not large enough to invalidate the work carried out so far.

Another issue presented concerned the length sampling data reported by fleets of Taiwan China. Recent levels of sampling have increased dramatically for this fleet, achieving very high levels for some spatio-temporal strata. A preliminary analysis of these data, and comparison with the length distributions reported in previous periods appears to show some unexpected changes in time on the range of sizes being caught or landed by this fleet. A comparison with data from other longline fleets shows also surprising discrepancies in catch-at-length data for fleets operating in similar ways and areas.

The possible sources of these patterns in the data are not clear at this point, and a number of hypothesis were discussed, although further work will be needed to understand precisely the implications and reasons of the observed patterns.

The group discussed briefly the ways in which the conditioning of the operating models for albacore could attenpt to incorporate the uncertainty in this source of data, specially given that the progression of length-at-age is an important part of the lijelihood of the population model currently applied. It was noted that one of the scneqrios already covered by the albacore OMs is that of giving less weight in the total likelihood to this data source.

- The group AGREED to explore further the possible uncertainties in the length-at-age data from Taiwan China, and how best to introduce it in the OM.

## Progress and ideas for the development on Albacore operating Models in ICCAT (L. Kell, ICCAT)

Current work on albacore OMs carried out by ICCAT was presented. Given the relatively similar frames of operation in terms of objectives and reference points between ICCAt and IOTC, this presentation was particularly informative, although significant differences also exist in the way the respective management and scientific bodies are going about development and evaluation of manaement plans.

ICCAt has also used the existing stock assessment, in this casebased on  Multifan-CL, as a basis for the OM, while the MPs being tested generally used a biomass-dynamic model based on longline CPUE to provide advice on stock status.

## Management strategy evaluation for the Indian Ocean skipjack tuna fishery : development of an operating model (N. Bentley, Trophia Ltd.)

## FLBEIA, a package for bio-economic evaluation of fisheries management plans (D. Garcia, AZTI Tecnalia)

A presentation was carried out on the ongoing development and application of an R/FLR package for simplified implementation of bio-economic simulations able to assess the economic impact of alternative regulations and management regimes. Although the work has been carried out for inmedate application in European fisheries, the framework is generic enough to accomodate other fishery systems. The availability of detailed economic data, so as to be able to assess the economic performance of different fleets, is obviously a limiting factor in the use of this type of analysis, but the group recognized the interest of seeing this kind of evaluation being carried out. Future situations in which MSE work in IOTC might need to move towards limited calculation of associated economic costs and benefits of certain management options was discussed. For example, the value of intensive tagging programmes, able to provide fishery-independent estimates of stock status, 

## Draft outline of MSE information session at IOTC SC 2014 (I. Mosqueira, EC JRC)

The chair and vice-chair of WPM have been asked by the IOTC Secretariat and the chair of the SC to prepare and carry out a training session on MSE during the next meeting of IOTC SC, 2-6 December 2013. A draft outline of the session was presented and briefly discussed. The proposed training is to be divided on three 30' sessions, and will present members of IOTC SC with a basic introduction to MSE, the essential of its mechanics, and allow them to interact with a simple example of MSE so they are able to explore some of the trade-offs, and understand the kind of outputs these exercises generate.

The draft outline of the session can be found in Appendix 1, and the development of the material is to be carried out over the next few weeks by the chair and vice-chair of WPM with the help of IOTC Secretariat.

Comments

- Movement problems, tagging not fully informative, but still worth exploring.
- Movement scenarios as robustness tests.
- Spatial problems of CPUEs.
- Additional sources of information to include.
- CPUE simulated from B, independent of catch.
- Objectives might not be so essential.
- Sampling from catches with uncertainties.
